Python Programming 


Task-2
Idea: BMI Calculator
 Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Allow users to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and visualize the result. Enable data storage for multiple users, historical data viewing, and BMI trend analysis through statistics and graphs.
Key Concepts and Challenges:
GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays.
Data Storage (for Advanced): Implement user data storage, possibly using file storage or a small database.
Data Visualization (for Advanced): Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts.
Error Handling (for Advanced): Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval.
User Experience (for Advanced): Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear instructions and feedback.


Task-3
Idea: Random Password Generator
Description:
Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. Enhance it by including options for password complexity, adherence to security rules, and clipboard integration for easy copying.
Key Concepts and Challenges:
GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation.
Security Rules (for Advanced): Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords.
Clipboard Integration (for Advanced): Allow users to copy generated passwords to the clipboard for convenience.
Customization (for Advanced): Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters.


Task-4
Idea: Basic Weather App
Description:
For Beginners: Create a command-line weather app in Python that fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location (e.g., city or ZIP code) using a weather API. Show basic information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
Key Concepts and Challenges:
API Integration: Connect to a weather API and parse JSON data.
User Input Handling: Validate and process user input for location.
